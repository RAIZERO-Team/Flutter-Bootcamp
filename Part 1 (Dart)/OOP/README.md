## CLASS & OBJECT

01- Class & Object
IN THIS EXAMPLE BELOW, THERE IS CLASS STUDENT WITH THREE PROPERTIES: NAME, AGE, AND
GRADE. THE CLASS ALSO HAS A METHOD CALLED DISPLAYINFO, WHICH PRINTS OUT THE VALUES OF
THE THREE PROPERTIES.

02- Class & Object
CREATE CLASS HOME WITH PROPERTIES NAME, ADDRESS, NUMBEROFROOMS.
CREATE A METHOD CALLED DISPLAY WHICH PRINTS OUT THE VALUES OF THE
PROPERTIES. CREATE AN OBJECT OF THE CLASS HOME AND SET THE VALUES OF THE
PROPERTIES. CALL THE METHOD DISPLAY TO PRINT OUT THE VALUES
OF THE PROPERTIES.

## CONSTRUCTOR

03- Default Constructor
TRY TO CREATE A CLASS PERSON WITH TWO PROPERTIES: NAME, AND PLANET. CREATE A DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR
TO INITIALIZE THE VALUES OF THE PLANET TO EARTH. CREATE AN OBJECT OF THE CLASS PERSON, SET THE NAME
TO “YOUR NAME” AND PRINT THE NAME AND PLANET.

04- Parametrized Constructor
THERE IS CLASS STUDENT WITH TWO PROPERTIES: NAME, AND AGE. THE CLASS HAS PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR
WITH DEFAULT VALUES. THE CONSTRUCTOR IS USED TO INITIALIZE THE VALUES OF THE TWO PROPERTIES. WE ALSO
HAVE AN OBJECT OF THE CLASS STUDENT CALLED STUDENT.

05- Named Constructor
TRY TO CREATE A CLASS CAR WITH THREE PROPERTIES NAME, COLOR, AND PRICE AND ONE METHOD DISPLAY WHICH PRINTS OUT
THE VALUES OF THE THREE PROPERTIES. CREATE A CONSTRUCTOR, WHICH TAKES ALL 3 PARAMETERS. CREATE A NAMED CONSTRUCTOR
WHICH TAKES TWO PARAMETERS NAME AND COLOR. CREATE AN OBJECT OF THE CLASS FROM BOTH THE CONSTRUCTORS AND
CALL THE METHOD DISPLAY.

06- Constant Constructor
CREATE A CLASS CUSTOMER WITH THREE PROPERTIES: NAME, AGE, AND PHONE. THE CLASS SHOULD HAVE
ONE CONSTANT CONSTRUCTOR. THE CONSTRUCTOR SHOULD INITIALIZE THE VALUES OF THE THREE
PROPERTIES. CREATE AN OBJECT OF THE CLASS CUSTOMER AND PRINT THE VALUES OF THE
THREE PROPERTIES.

07- Factory Constructor
CREATE AN INTERFACE CALLED BOTTLE AND ADD A METHOD TO IT CALLED OPEN(). CREATE A CLASS
CALLED COKEBOTTLE AND IMPLEMENT THE BOTTLE AND PRINT THE MESSAGE “COKE BOTTLE IS
OPENED”
. ADD A FACTORY CONSTRUCTOR TO BOTTLE AND RETURN THE OBJECT OF COKEBOTTLE.
INSTANTIATE COKEBOTTLE USING THE FACTORY CONSTRUCTOR AND CALL THE
OPEN() ON THE OBJECT.

## ENCAPSULATION

08- Encapsulation1
THERE IS A CLASS NAMED STUDENT WITH THREE PRIVATE PROPERTIES _FIRSTNAME, _LASTNAME AND
_AGE. THERE ARE TWO GETTERS FULLNAME AND AGE TO GET THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES. THERE ARE
ALSO THREE SETTERS FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME AND AGE TO UPDATE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES. IF
AGE IS LESS THAN 0, IT WILL THROW AN ERROR.

09- Encapsulation2
WE HAVE CREATED A CLASS NAMED VEHICLE. THE CLASS HAS TWO PRIVATE PROPERTIES
_MODEL AND _YEAR. WE HAVE ALSO CREATED TWO GETTER AND SETTER METHODS FOR EACH
PROPERTY. THE GETTER AND SETTER METHODS ARE NAMED MODEL AND YEAR. THE GETTER
AND SETTER METHODS ARE USED TO ACCESS AND UPDATE THE VALUE OF THE PRIVATE PROPERTIE

## INHERITANCE

10- Single Inheritance
THERE IS SUPER CLASS NAMED CAR WITH TWO PROPERTIES
NAME AND PRICE. THERE IS SUB CLASS NAMED TESLA WHICH INHERITS THE PROPERTIES
OF THE SUPER CLASS. THE SUB CLASS HAS A METHOD DISPLAY TO DISPLAY THE VALUES OF
THE PROPERTIES

11- Multiple Inheritance
THERE IS CLASS NAMED PERSON WITH TWO PROPERTIES
NAME AND AGE. THERE IS SUB CLASS NAMED DOCTOR WITH PROPERTIES LISTOFDEGREES
AND HOSPITALNAME. THERE IS ANOTHER SUBCLASS NAMED SPECIALIST WITH PROPERTY
SPECIALIZATION. THE SUB CLASS HAS A METHOD DISPLAY TO DISPLAY THE VALUES OF THE
PROPERTIES

12- Hierarchical Inheritance
THERE IS CLASS NAMED SHAPE WITH TWO PROPERTIES
DIAMETER1 AND DIAMETER2. THERE IS SUB CLASS NAMED RECTANGLE WITH METHOD
AREA TO CALCULATE THE AREA OF THE RECTANGLE. THERE IS ANOTHER SUBCLASS NAMED
TRIANGLE WITH METHOD AREA TO CALCULATE THE AREA OF THE TRIANGLE

13- Inheritance of Contructor and Super Keyword
THERE IS CLASS NAMED LAPTOP WITH A CONSTRUCTOR WITH
PARAMETERS. THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS NAMED MACBOOK WHICH EXTENDS THE
LAPTOP CLASS. THE MACBOOK CLASS HAS ITS OWN CONSTRUCTOR WITH PARAMETERS.

## POLYMORPHISM

14- Polymorphism
THERE IS A CLASS NAMED EMPLOYEE WITH A METHOD
NAMED SALARY(). THE SALARY() METHOD IS OVERRIDDEN IN TWO CHILD CLASSES NAMED
MANAGER AND DEVELOPER

## ABSTRACT & INTERFACE

15- Abstract Class
THERE IS AN ABSTRACT CLASS SHAPE WITH ONE ABSTRACT
METHOD AREA() AND TWO SUBCLASSES RECTANGLE AND TRIANGLE. THE SUBCLASSES
IMPLEMENT THE AREA() METHOD AND OVERRIDE IT TO CALCULATE THE AREA OF THE
RECTANGLE AND TRIANGLE, RESPECTIVELY

16- Interface Class
THERE IS AN INTERFACE LAPTOP WITH TWO METHODS
TURNON() AND TURNOFF(). THE CLASS MACBOOK IMPLEMENTS THE INTERFACE AND
OVERRIDES THE METHODS TO PRINT THE MESSAGE.

## MIXIN

17- Mixin
THERE ARE TWO MIXINS NAMED ELECTRICVARIANT AND
PETROLVARIANT. THE ELECTRICVARIANT MIXIN HAS A METHOD ELECTRICVARIANT() AND
THE PETROLVARIANT MIXIN HAS A METHOD PETROLVARIANT(). THE CAR CLASS USES BOTH
THE ELECTRICVARIANT AND PETROLVARIANT MIXINS.

## ENUM
18- ENUM
THERE IS ENUM TYPE NAMED DAYS. IT CONTAINS SEVEN
CONSTANTS DAYS. THE DAYS ENUM TYPE IS USED IN THE MAIN() FUNCTION.

## Generics
