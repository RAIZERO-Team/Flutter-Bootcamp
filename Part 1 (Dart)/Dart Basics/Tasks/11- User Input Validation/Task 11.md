## Task 11: User Input Validation

```md
Create a Dart program that simulates user registration. 
The program should take a username, password, and age as input.

Use assertions to validate:
* The username is not empty and has a minimum length of 3 characters.
* The password is not empty and has a minimum length of 8 characters.
* The age is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 18.

Provide custom error messages for each assertion. The program should print a success message if all assertions pass
```
